## Next Steps

### Images You Still Need:

1. **Your Professional Photo** - A high-quality photo of Jeff J Hunter for the "From the Creator" section
2. **Additional Reward Tier Graphics** - Create variations for the other 5 tiers using the same template as the Best Value tier
3. **More Death Scenarios** - Generate 2-3 more unique death scenes for variety
4. **Campaign Video** - Film and edit the 120-second video using these assets as B-roll

### How to Create Additional Reward Tiers:

Use the same design template as `reward_tier_best_value.png` but adjust:
- The title and price
- The number of Chrono-Shards shown
- The reward text
- Remove "BEST VALUE" banner for other tiers

### Tips for Using These Assets:

- All images follow the "no gradients" rule with solid colors
- The cyan-blue color (#00D9FF approximately) is your brand accent
- Large, readable text is prioritized throughout
- Images work together as a cohesive visual system
- The Chrono-Shard icon can be used anywhere for brand consistency
