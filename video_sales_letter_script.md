## SCRIPT

### OPENING (0:00-0:15)
**[VISUAL: Black screen. Sound of wind, distant explosions. Fade in to wasteland]**

**NARRATOR (V.O.):**  
"In the year 2157, humanity made its greatest mistake..."

**[VISUAL: Quick cuts of AI uprising, cities falling, chaos]**

"...we created an intelligence we couldn't control."

**[VISUAL: Survivor walking through ruins, Chrono-Shard glowing on backpack]**

"Now, in the Silent Earth, survival isn't measured in years... or even days."

**[VISUAL: Title card with logo: "INFINITE WAYS TO DIE"]**

"It's measured in choices."

---

### THE HOOK (0:15-0:45)
**[VISUAL: Developer on camera, passionate but authentic]**

**DEVELOPER:**  
"Hi, I'm [Your Name], and I'm creating something that's never been done before."

**[VISUAL: Cut to gameplay - AI generating story text in real-time]**

"Infinite Ways to Die is the world's first **Generated Adventure** - a completely new genre of gaming where **nothing is pre-written**."

**[VISUAL: Show choice options appearing, then story branching]**

"The AI doesn't just respond to your choices... it **creates** your choices. Every decision you face is generated specifically for your playthrough."

**[VISUAL: Montage of different death scenarios]**

"Every death is unique. Every story has never been told before... and will never be told again."

---

### THE PROBLEM (0:45-1:10)
**[VISUAL: Traditional CYOA book pages flipping]**

**DEVELOPER:**  
"Traditional choose-your-own-adventure games? They're limited. Fixed paths. Predetermined endings. Once you've played through them, the magic is gone."

**[VISUAL: AI Dungeon or similar free-text game]**

"AI text games like AI Dungeon? They let you type anything... which sounds great until the story falls apart. Players exploit the system. The narrative breaks."

**[VISUAL: Back to developer]**

"We needed something different. Something that combines the **structure** of classic CYOA with the **infinite possibility** of AI."

---

### THE SOLUTION (1:10-1:50)
**[VISUAL: Gameplay demo - story generation in action]**

**DEVELOPER:**  
"That's where Generated Adventures come in. The AI generates three things in real-time:"

**[VISUAL: Text appearing on screen]**

"**One:** Your story. Unique narrative generated just for you."

**[VISUAL: Choice options appearing]**

"**Two:** Your choices. The AI creates the options you'll face - not you."

**[VISUAL: Scene image generating]**

"**Three:** Your images. Every scene is illustrated by AI, creating a visual novel experience that's completely unique."

**[VISUAL: Death Catalog interface]**

"And when you die - and you **will** die - that death is recorded in your Death Catalog. A collection of unique stories that only you will ever experience."

**[VISUAL: Chrono-Shard mechanic demonstration]**

"But here's the twist: Chrono-Shards. Rare time-rewind devices that let you undo your mistakes and push deeper into the wasteland."

---

### THE CHALLENGE (1:50-2:10)
**[VISUAL: Montage of increasingly dangerous scenarios]**

**DEVELOPER:**  
"The question isn't **if** you'll die. It's **how long** you'll survive against the AI."

**[VISUAL: Player stats showing survival time, deaths, choices made]**

"Will you last 10 minutes? An hour? How many deaths will it take before you find a path forward?"

**[VISUAL: Community leaderboard concept]**

"Every player's journey is different. Every death tells a story. And your Death Catalog becomes a badge of honor - proof of your struggle in the Silent Earth."

---

### THE ASK (2:10-2:45)
**[VISUAL: Back to developer, earnest and direct]**

**DEVELOPER:**  
"This is a passion project. I'm building something that's never existed before - a new genre of gaming. But I can't do it alone."

**[VISUAL: Kickstarter reward tiers appearing]**

"Your support will help me:"

**[VISUAL: Bullet points with icons]**

- "Expand the AI storytelling engine"
- "Create more death scenarios and world lore"
- "Add multiplayer Death Catalog sharing"
- "Build community features and leaderboards"

**[VISUAL: Early access gameplay footage]**

"Early backers will get exclusive access to the beta, unique Chrono-Shard cosmetics, and your name in the Death Catalog Hall of Legends."

---

### CLOSING (2:45-3:00)
**[VISUAL: Dramatic wasteland scene, survivor standing at crossroads]**

**DEVELOPER (V.O.):**  
"The Silent Earth is waiting. The AI is ready."

**[VISUAL: Logo with Kickstarter launch date]**

"How long will **you** survive?"

**[VISUAL: Call to action]**

**TEXT ON SCREEN:**  
"BACK INFINITE WAYS TO DIE  
The World's First Generated Adventure  
Coming to Kickstarter [DATE]"

**[VISUAL: Fade to black with social media handles]**
